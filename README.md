# homebrew-CXPatcher
### All the Credits to Stonerl who is the creator of this homebrew cask.
I just modified the repo so i can use it, because the original isn't working at the present moment.

    $ brew tap Naicriz/CXPatcher

Install CXPatcher with:

    $ brew install --cask cxpatcher

Optionally(if don't have it already), you can install GStreamer with:

    $ brew install --cask gstreamer
