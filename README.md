# homebrew-CXPatcher-GStreamer
_All the Credits to Stonerl who is the creator of this homebrew cask._

I just modified the repo so I could be able to use it.

Adding the repo:

    $ brew tap Naicriz/CXPatcher

Install CXPatcher with:

    $ brew install --cask cxpatcher

Optionally(if don't have it already), you can install GStreamer with:

    $ brew install --cask gstreamer
